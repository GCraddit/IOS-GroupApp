# *FIND YOU* â€“ iOS App 
*FIND YOU* is a SwiftUI-based iOS app designed to help international students and local residents discover, collect, and participate in nearby cultural activities.
In addition to its user-friendly interface and geo-based event recommendations, the app also features **merchant accounts** that allow verified users to publish events, attracting local attention in real-time and potentially generating revenue through participation, sponsorships, or foot traffic.
This dual-purpose design ensures that the app is not only socially useful, but also **financially sustainable** in future iterations.
